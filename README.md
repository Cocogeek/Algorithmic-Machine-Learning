# Algorithmic-Machine-Learning
These notebooks were carried out as part of my first year of master at Eurecom, during the AML class.  
These projects were realised in team with yasserben. (link of his github here : https://github.com/yasserben)  

The notebooks are organised :  
-Study of the data  
-Preprocessing of the data  
-Modelling and parameter optimization  
-Application on test data  

The first lab is a large-scale recommender system using ALS algorithm.  
The second notebook is taken from a Kaggle challenge and aims at predicting house prices using ElasticNet, Lasso, Ridge algorithms.  
The third work deals with classification of images of plankton using a Convolutionnal Neural Network.  
Finally, the last one is about anomaly detection using Rule Based
